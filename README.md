Name - Greg Pannone

Major - AIM major, minor CS

Fact - Currently running a startup known as "Racr", it started as a social media platform dedicated towards motorsports, but has since pivoted to a motorsports and motor enthusiasts. We recently pivoted to a gpt based ai using the gpt 4 api and gpt vision. Check us out on ios and android. 

Experience - No formal DS experience, best I have done is basic analysis on mysql dbs and accounting audit.

Response to quote from encrypted_message_2 - I think the quote points out very important issues we see in society as a whole, especially in how we interact with media. Many people arent educated on the differences between correlation and causation. Often time we see the manipulation of data to affirm agendas, framing data in very objective manners. We must be aware on these facets on dealing with data and the media.
